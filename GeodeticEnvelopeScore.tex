\begin{abstract}
A compactness metric is introduced which can be used to measure the degree of gerrymandering in a U.S. Congressional voting district.
The metric is defined using a geodetic envelope: a polygon bounded by lines of latitude and longitude on the surface of the earth.
The metric was motivated by noticing that many of the original state boundaries were defined using meridians and parallels. The
metric requires that the surface area of a geodetic envelope is calculated; which is done using multiple methods in applied mathematics.
The resulting compactness scores show many advantages over currently used metrics such as Reock, Polsby-Popper and Schwatzberg. A 
bond-like rating system based on the new metric is suggested to simplify the communication of a district's compactness score.

\section{Introduction}
Several measures have been proposed to quantify the degree to which congressional districts are 
gerrymandered. Many of these metrics measure the compactness of a district by 
comparing a geometrical property of the district, such as area or perimeter, to that property 
in a related ideal shape. The related ideal shapes are typically circles or rectangles. 
For example, the Reock score is the ratio of the area of a district to the area of the minimum 
circumscribing circle of the district. The Polsby-Popper score is the ratio of the area of a district 
to the area of a circle whose perimeter is the same as the district's perimeter. The Schwartzberg score
is the ratio of the perimeter of a district to the perimeter of a circle having the same area as the 
district.

The book ``How The States Got Their Shapes'', \cite{stein}, documents the history of how the states got 
their boundaries. Boundaries can be natural, political, based on the division of resources, 
on a principle such as equality, or be given in the King's charter. The most common state 
boundaries, however, were defined by ``parallels'' or lines of latitude, and ``meridians'' or line of longitude. 
Kansas, Nebraska, South Dakota and North Dakota all have 3° of latitudinal height. Colorado, 
Wyoming and Montana all have 4°. Washington, Oregon, Colorado, Wyoming,
North Dakota and South Dakota all have about 7° of longitudinal width. The southern borders of Virginia,
Kentucky and Missouri are all at 37.5° latitude. Indeed a large section of the northern border of the 
United States is at 49° latitude. Thus, it seems natural to use lines of latitude and longitude in the 
definition of a compactness score for voting districts.


\section{The Geodetic Envelope Score}

A \textit{geodetic envelope} or simply \textit{envelope} is a Geographic Information System (GIS) / Open Geospatial
Consortium (OGC) designated term defining a region specified by two latitude-longitude points. The two points are 
taken to be $(\lambda_{min},\varphi_{min})$ and $(\lambda_{max},\varphi_{max})$, where $\lambda$ denotes
longitude and $\varphi$ denotes geodetic latitude. As a measure of district gerrymandering we propose the
\textit{Geodetic Envelope Score} defined as follows.
\begin{definition}[Geodetic Envelope Score]
Let $D$ be a district and $S$ the geodetic envelope containing $D$. The Geodetic Envelope Score of district $D$ is
\[GE = \frac{A(D)}{A(S)}
\]
where $A$ is the area operator.
\end{definition}
$S$ is a surface on the WGS-84 reference ellipsoid model of the earth.

\subsection{Envelope Area as a Surface of Revolution}
\label{sec:SREllipse}
The envelope area of $S$ is the surface area of $S$, denoted $A(S)$. If $a$ is the semi-major axis and $b$ the 
semi-minor axis of the reference ellipsoid, then the surface area of $A(S)$ can be computed by rotating 
the ``meridian'' ellipse, ${x^2}/{a^2} + {y^2}/{b^2} = 1$ about its minor axis. 
The values for $a=6378.137$ km and $b=6356.752$ km are defined by the world geodetic system (WGS)-84. 
Also, the first eccentricity of the earth $e$ is related to the ellipses' axes by the formula
$e=((a^2-b^2)/a^2)^{1/2}$ and has the value $e=0.081819$, \cite{noureldin}. 
The area of the surface generated by rotating a horizontal
element of area from $y=y_1$ to $y=y_2$ about the semi-minor y-axis is
\begin{equation*}
    A(S) = 2\pi(\frac{a}{b})\int_{y_1}^{y_2}\sqrt{b^2+e'^2y^2} dy
\end{equation*}
In this equation $e'$ is called the second eccentricity of the earth; it is given by 
the formula $e'=((a^2-b^2)/b^2)^{1/2}$ and has the value $e'=0.082094$. 
To check the validity of the above equation for surface area consider the case of rotating a circle,
that is, set $a=b$, $e'=0$ and $y_1=0$, $y_2=a$. Then $A(S)=2\pi a^2$ which is the surface area of a hemi-sphere. 
For the general case, evaluating the above integral leads to a formula for the surface area of an envelope
\begin{equation}
    A(S) = \frac{ab}{2e'}(sec(u)tan(u)+ln|sec(u)+tan(u)|)\Big|_{u_1}^{u_2}(\lambda_2-\lambda_1)(\frac{\pi}{180})
\label{eq:SAEllipsoid}
\end{equation}
Here, longitude ($\lambda$) and latitude ($\varphi$) are given in degrees.
The limits of integration are $u_1 = tan^{-1}((e'/b)y_1)$, $u_2 = tan^{-1}((e'/b)y_2)$ where 
$y_1 = N(\varphi_1)(1-e^2)sin(\varphi_1)$ and $y_2 = N(\varphi_2)(1-e^2)sin(\varphi_2)$. 
$N$ is the earth's prime-vertical radius of curvature and has the formula
\[
N(\varphi)=\frac{a}{\sqrt{(1-e^2sin^2(\varphi))}}.
\]
A derivation of \eqref{eq:SAEllipsoid} is given in the Appendix.

\subsection{Envelope Area by Map Projection}
Another possibility of computing the area of a geodetic envelope
is to project the envelope onto a planar region in two dimensional Euclidean space 
and compute the area there. The area of the planar region can be computed as a line integral over the
boundary of the region using Green's Theorem, \cite{engmath}. 
It can be shown that this line integral is equal to,
\begin{equation*}
    A = \frac{1}{2} \oint x \,dy - y \,dx
\end{equation*}
The cited reference points out the interesting fact that this theorem is the principle behind 
how certain planimeters (devices which measure area) work.

The Equal Earth Projection \cite{ee2018} is a modern equal-area, pseudocylindrical map projection. It 
accomplishes the task of projecting the vertices of the envelope onto a planar region.
Suppose a geodetic envelope is defined by the WGS-84 coordinates $(\lambda_1,\varphi_1)$ and 
$(\lambda_2,\varphi_2)$. That is, $S$ consists of the vertices of the polygon
$A=(\lambda_{min},\varphi_{min})$, $B=(\lambda_{max},\varphi_{min})$, $C=(\lambda_{max},\varphi_{max})$
and $D=(\lambda_{min},\varphi_{max})$.
Since the vertices $A$ and $B$ have the same latitude, they will be projected onto points with the same $y$ 
value in Euclidean space. 
Denote the projected points $A'=(x_1,y_1)$, $B'=(x_2,y_1)$, $C'=(x_3,y_2)$ and $D'=(x_4,y_2)$. 
A parameterization for the boundary of the projected region in the positive counter-clockwise
direction is,
\[
\begin{cases}
    \begin{array}{lll}
        x(t) = x_1 + (x_2-x_1)t, & y=y_1; & 0 \le t < 1, \\
        x(t) = x_2 + (x_3-x_2)(t-1), & y=y_1 + (y_2-y_1)(t-1); & 1 \le t < 2, \\
        x(t) = x_3 + (x_4-x_3)(t-2), & y=y_2; & 2 \le t < 3, \\
        x(t) = x_4 + (x_1-x_4)(t-3), & y=y_2 + (y_1-y_2)(t-3); & 3 \le t \le 4.        
    \end{array}
\end{cases}
\]
Using this parameterization to evaluate the line integral in Green's Theorem gives,
\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
        A(S) &= \frac{1}{2}(-y_1(x_2-x_1) + x_2(y_2-y_1) \\
        &\quad - y_1(x_3-x_2) - y_2(x_4-x_3) + x_4(y_1-y_2) - y_2(x_1-x_4))        
    \end{split}
\label{eq:SAProjection}
\end{equation}

Formula \eqref{eq:SAProjection} is an alternative to \eqref{eq:SAEllipsoid} for computing the 
surface area of a geodetic envelope. 
The relative differences in percent between using \eqref{eq:SAEllipsoid} and \eqref{eq:SAProjection} 
have a maximum value of less than 0.1\%.

\subsection{Envelope Area using Spherical Earth Model}
If, instead of the reference ellipsoid, a sphere of radius $a$ is taken as a model of the earth,
\eqref{eq:SAEllipsoid} simplifies to 
\begin{equation}
    A(S) = a^2(sin(\varphi_2)-sin(\varphi_1))(\lambda_2-\lambda_1)(\frac{\pi}{180})
\label{eq:SASphere}
\end{equation}
As before, longitude ($\lambda$) and latitude ($\varphi$) are given in degrees.
This formula can be derived in a manner similar to rotating the meridian ellipse about the minor axis.
The differences in calculated area of envelopes between the ellipsoidal earth-model
\eqref{eq:SAEllipsoid} and the spherical earth-model
\eqref{eq:SASphere} are shown in Figure ~\ref{fig:CmpAreaSphere}. In this figure the
districts have been sorted by the median latitude of the envelope: districts with lower
district numbers have a lower median latitude than districts with higher district numbers.
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{cmpAreaSphere.png}
    \caption{Envelope Area Differences with Spherical Earth-Model}
    \label{fig:CmpAreaSphere}
\end{figure}

The minimum value of -588 $km^2$ at index $23$ is district TX23. This Texas district is on the 
United States' southern border with Mexico.
The maximum value of 657 $km^2$ at index $415$ is district MT02. This Montana district is on the 
United States' northern border with Canada. In other words, the spherical approximation overestimates
the envelope area for states in the southern United States and underestimates envelope area for states 
in the northern United States.

The relative error in percent of the spherical earth model approximation ranges from a minimum value
of 0.0009\% at latitude 37.785\textdegree to maximum values 0.2634\%, 0.2454\% at latitudes 
25.101\textdegree, 48.390\textdegree, respectively.

\subsection{Envelope Area using Spherical Geometry}
An geodetic envelope can be represented geometrically as the difference between two spherical triangles. 
Again, suppose the envelope is defined by the WGS-84 coordinates $(\lambda_1,\varphi_1)$ and 
$(\lambda_2,\varphi_2)$. The larger triangle consists of the vertices $(\lambda_1,\varphi_{min})$,
$(\lambda_2,\varphi_{min})$ and the North Pole and the smaller triangle consists of the vertices 
$(\lambda_1,\varphi_{max})$, $(\lambda_2,\varphi_{max})$ and the North Pole. 
The area of the geodetic envelope is the area of the larger spherical triangle minus the area of the smaller spherical 
triangle.

The area of a spherical triangle can be computed using Girard's theorem, \cite{strig}.
Let $E$ denote the sum of the interior angles of the spherical triangle, then the area of a spherical triangle on a
sphere of radius $R$ is
\begin{equation}
    A = (E-\pi)R^2
\label{eq:SAGirard}
\end{equation}
The spherical excess is the amount by which the sum of the angles of a spherical triangle exceeds $\pi$ radians.
To apply Girard's theorem, the interior angles of the spherical triangle need to be found. 

Determining these angles is known as the Indirect or Inverse Problem of Geodesy \cite{volpe}
\begin{definition}[Inverse Problem of Geodesy]
Given points $A$ and $B$ with coordinates
$(\lambda_A,\varphi_A)$ and $(\lambda_B,\varphi_B)$, respectively, find the geocentric angle $\theta$
connecting $A$ and $B$ and the azimuth angles $\psi_{B/A}$ and $\psi_{A/B}$ from north 
of the path at each end.    
\end{definition}
The aforementioned reference gives formulas for the azimuth angles,
\begin{equation*}
    tan(\psi_{B/A})=\frac{cos(\varphi_B)sin(\lambda_B-\lambda_A)}{sin(\varphi_B)cos(\varphi_A)-cos(\varphi_B)sin(\varphi_A)cos(\lambda_B-\lambda_A)}
\end{equation*}
and
\begin{equation*}
    tan(\psi_{A/B})=\frac{cos(\varphi_A)sin(\lambda_A-\lambda_B)}{sin(\varphi_A)cos(\varphi_B)-cos(\varphi_A)sin(\varphi_B)cos(\lambda_A-\lambda_B)}
\end{equation*}
The third angle of the navigational triangle is the angle at the North Pole. The value of this angle is equal to 
$\lambda_B - \lambda_A$. $E$ is the sum of these three angles: the azimuth angles 
and the angle at the North Pole. 

All together four methods have been presented to calculate geodetic envelope area.
Figure~\ref{fig:CmpAreaCDF} summarizes the differences in calculating this area using 
equations \eqref{eq:SAEllipsoid}, \eqref{eq:SAProjection}, \eqref{eq:SASphere}, and \eqref{eq:SAGirard}.
Taking the surface of revolution method discussed in Section~\ref{sec:SREllipse} as the benchmark, the figure 
shows the distribution of differences of surface area from the benchmark.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{cmpAreaCDF.png}
    \caption{Comparison of Envelope Area Differences}
    \label{fig:CmpAreaCDF}
\end{figure}
The Projection method is the closest in agreement with the benchmark since both methods assume an
ellipsoidal earth-model. There are minor deviations in surface area for larger size envelopes.
Both the spherical surface of revolution formula \eqref{eq:SASphere} and spherical geometrical
formula \eqref{eq:SAGirard} are in good agreement with the benchmark. The deviations in these
two methods correspond to smaller and larger latitudes, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:CmpAreaSphere}. 
As expected, both spherical earth-models are in good agreement with each other.

\section{Comparison with Polsby-Popper Score}
Of the several measures mentioned in the Introduction, the Polsby-Popper score was chosen as a representative for
comparison. 
The Polsby-Popper (PP) score \cite{pp1991} is the ratio of the area of a district to the area of a circle 
whose circumference is equal to the perimeter of the district. That is,

\begin{equation*}
PP = \frac{A(D)}{A(R)}
\end{equation*}
where $D$ represents the district and $R$ a circle with $P(D) = P(R)$. If $d$ is the diameter of circle $R$ then 
$A(R)=\pi(d^2/2)$ and by substitution,

\begin{equation}
PP = 4\pi\frac{A(D)}{P(D)^2}
\label{eq:PP}
\end{equation}
Applications of \eqref{eq:PP} are shown in the following examples.
\begin{example}
Suppose $D$ is a rectangle with height $h$ and length $l$. The Polsby-Popper score for the rectangle is
\[
PP = \pi\frac{lh}{(l+h)^2}
\]
If $l=h$ (a square) then $PP=0.79$, if $l=2$, $h=1$ then $PP=0.70$, and if $l=4$, $h=1$ then $PP=0.50$.
\end{example}

\begin{example}
Suppose $D$ is an ellipse with semi-major axis $a$ and semi-minor axis $b$. Let $C$ denote the boundary of
the ellipse and choose the parametric equations for $C$ to be $x=acos(t)$, $y=bsin(t)$ for $0 \le t \le 2\pi$. 
Thus $C$ is traversed in the counter-clockwise (positive) direction. Then using Green's Theorem in the 
plane \cite{engmath}, with $P=-y/2$ and $Q=x/2$,
\[
A(D) = \oint_C -\frac{y}{2} \, dx + \frac{x}{2} \, dy = \int_0^{2\pi} [\frac{ab}{2}sin^2(t)+\frac{ab}{2}cos^2(t)] \, dt = \pi{ab}
\]
Furthermore, the perimeter of the ellipse can be written \cite{abramowitz}
\[
P(D) = 4aE(e)
\]
where $E$ is the elliptical integral of the second kind and $e$ is the eccentricity of the ellipse. 
Formulas for $E$ and $e$ are shown in the Appendix. The Polsby-Popper score for the ellipse is
\[
PP = \frac{\pi}{4}\frac{b}{a}[E^2(e)]^{-1}
\]
If $a=b$ (a circle) then $PP=1$, if $a=2$, $b=1$ then $PP=0.71$, and if $a=4$, $b=1$ then $PP=0.49$.
\end{example}
These examples show that the ratio: area of a district $D$ divided by area of a circle $R$ 
can lead to low compactness scores even for reasonably shaped districts 
such as rectangles or ellipses. 
This fact, illustrated for the Polsby-Popper score, would also hold true for the other metrics
based on the circle: Roeck and Schwartzberg.
This is obvious since, in general, the circle doesn't cover rectangles or ellipses very well.

\section{Results}
In the results of this section the area of the geodetic envelope was computed using \eqref{eq:SAEllipsoid}.
Figure~\ref{fig:Histogram} compares the Geodetic Envelope score with the Polsby-Popper score. 
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{hist.png}
    \caption{Histogram of Geodetic Envelope and Polsby-Popper score.}
    \label{fig:Histogram}
\end{figure}
The average value of the Geodetic Envelope score, $0.4724$, is almost twice that of the 
Polsby-Popper score, $0.2465$. This implies that geodetic envelopes are more suited as a compactness 
measure than circles.

\subsection{District Comparison}
Table~\ref{tab:top5-districts} compares the top 5 district scores: Geodetic Envelope and Polsby-Popper

\end{tabular}
\caption{Top 5 Districts}
\label{tab:top5-districts}
\end{table}
District ND00 encompasses the entire state of North Dakota and when viewed on a map 
is a reasonable looking rectangle. 
Its Geodetic Envelope score of $0.9281$ ranks second among all districts. 
The Polsby-Popper score of $0.4761$, however, ranks ND00 20th: more evidence
that the Geodetic Envelope score is more suitable than the Polsby-Popper score.

The not simply-connected archipeligo districts AK00 and HI02 in Alaska and Hawaii, respectively, 
have by far the worst compactness scores.
For example, the Polsby-Popper score of AK00 is $O(10^{-4})$. 
Thus, when comparing the bottom 5 districts, the states Alaska and Hawaii were considered outliers 
and removed from the analysis. 
Table \ref{tab:bottom5-districts} compares the bottom 5 district scores 
\begin{table}[H]

\\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Bottom 5 Districts}
\label{tab:bottom5-districts}
\end{table}
Districts CA11 and CA42 have the lowest scores for both compactness measures. 
The relative difference in percent
between these two districts is $((.0677-.0424) / .05505) * 100 = 45.96\%$
for the Geodetic Envelope Score and $((.0295-.0260) / .02775) * 100 = 12.61\%$ for the Polsby-Popper score.
The Geodetic Envelope Score does a better job of distinguishing districts with low compactness scores.

\subsection{State Comparison}
A state-wide comparison was made by calculating the average of the Geodetic Envelope and Polsby-Popper 
scores over all the districts of each state. The goal of this comparison was to measure the districting of 
states on average. Table~\ref{tab:bottom10-states} shows the states with the lowest scores according to each measure.
\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}

\end{tabular}
\\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Bottom 10 States}
\label{tab:bottom10-states}
\end{table}
To interpret this ranking it is helpful to consider only those states with at least 3 districts. 
This excludes AK, HI, NH and RI. 
In this case, the bottom three states are LA, MA and IL according to both measures.

\subsection{Ratings}
As seen in Figure \ref{fig:Histogram} or in Tables \ref{tab:top5-districts} and \ref{tab:bottom5-districts},
the Geodetic Envelope score ranges over the interval $(0,1)$.
Dividing the interval into 10 equal parts given by $[0.1*(n-1), 0.1*(n)]$ for $n=1,2,\ldots,10$, 
and labeling each part
\[
\{AAA, \mathpunct{\allowbreak} AA, \mathpunct{\allowbreak} A, \mathpunct{\allowbreak} BBB, \mathpunct{\allowbreak} BB, 
\mathpunct{\allowbreak} B, \mathpunct{\allowbreak} CCC, \mathpunct{\allowbreak} CC, \mathpunct{\allowbreak} C, 
\mathpunct{\allowbreak} D\}
\]
the Geodetic Envelope score can be identified with a user-friendly, bond-like rating.
Table~\ref{tab:district-ratings} shows the results of applying this rating assignment to some of the 
districts in Tables \ref{tab:top5-districts} and \ref{tab:bottom5-districts}.

\section{Conclusion}
The Geodetic Envelope Score was shown to be a natural measure of district compactness because it is
defined using ``parallels'' and ``meridians''; the lines used in the original definition of state boundaries.
A number of methods were developed to compute this score stemming from a sundry of applied mathematical
disciplines. The characteristics and limitations of each method was summarized.
In comparison with the Polsby-Popper score the Geodetic Envelope score computed values are more in line with
expectations, especially for reasonably shaped districts. 
Finally, the Geodetic Envelope score permits the assignment of a user-friendly rating to classify the 
compactness of a district.

The elliptical integral of the second kind is given by
\[
E(e^2) = \int_0^{2\pi} \sqrt{1 - e^2sin^2(\theta)} \, d\theta
\]
The eccentricity of an ellipse, also called the first eccentricity is given by

\subsection*{Derivation of Surface Area of Envelope}
The surface area of the surface of revolution generated by revolving the graph of $x=x(y)$ about the y-axis is
\begin{equation}
    S = 2\pi\int_{y}^{b} x \sqrt{1 + (\frac{dx}{dy})^2} \,dy
\end{equation}
In this case, the surface of revolution is generated by revolving the `meridian' ellipse $x^2/a^2 + y^2/b^2 = 1$. Then
the surface area of the surface of revolution obtained from revolving a region from a given point $y$ up to $b$ is found 
by substituting $dx/dy = -a^2y/b^2x$ into the above equation
\begin{align*}
    S(y)&= 2\pi\int_{y}^{b}x\sqrt{\frac{b^4x^2+a^4y^2}{b^4x^2}} \,dy \\
        &= \frac{2\pi}{b^2}\int_{y}^{b}\sqrt{b^4x^2+a^4y^2} \, dy \\
        &= \frac{2\pi}{b^2}\int_{y}^{b}\sqrt{b^4(a^2-\frac{a^2}{b^2y^2})+a^4y^2} \, dy \\
        &= \frac{2\pi}{b^2}(ab)\int_{y}^{b}\sqrt{b^2-y^2+\frac{a^2}{b^2}y^2} \, dy \\
        &= 2\pi(\frac{a}{b})\int_{y}^{b}\sqrt{b^2+\frac{a^2-b^2}{b^2}y^2} \, dy \\
        &= 2\pi(\frac{a}{b})\int_{y}^{b}\sqrt{b^2+e'^2y^2} \, dy \\
\end{align*}
The surface area of the latitudinal band between points $y=y_1$ and $y=y_2$ is $S=S(y_1)-S(y_2)$, or
\begin{equation*}
    S = 2\pi\int_{y_1}^{y_2} \sqrt{b^2+e'^2y^2} \,dy
\end{equation*}
where $y_1 = N(1-e^2)sin(\varphi_1)$ and $y_1 = N(1-e^2)sin(\varphi_2)$. To evaluate the integral let $y=(b/e')tan(u)$. 
The integral becomes
\begin{equation*}
    S = 2\pi(\frac{ab}{e'})\int_{u_1}^{u_2} sec^3(u) \,du
\end{equation*}
The integral of $sec^3(x)$ can be found by integration by parts, letting $u=sec(x)$ and $dv=sec^2(x)dx$. The result is
\begin{equation*}
    S = (\frac{\pi}{e'})(ab)(sec(u)tan(u)+ln|sec(u)+tan(u)|)\Big|_{u_1}^{u_2}
\end{equation*}
If $\Delta s$ is the arc length corresponding to a change of longitude $\Delta\lambda$ in a circle of radius $R$ then
\begin{equation*}
    \frac{\Delta s}{2\pi R} = \frac{\Delta\lambda Ncos(\varphi)}{2\pi Ncos(\varphi)} = \frac{\Delta\lambda}{2\pi}
\end{equation*}
Multiplying this factor by the above equation and allowing for $\lambda$, $\varphi$ to be given in degrees, the surface area
of a geodetic envelope is
\begin{equation*}
    S = \frac{ab}{2e'}(sec(u)tan(u)+ln|sec(u)+tan(u)|)\Big|_{u_1}^{u_2}(\lambda_2-\lambda_1)(\frac{\pi}{180})
\end{equation*}
A similar derivation can be done for \eqref{eq:SASphere} by assuming the earth geoid is 
modeled by a sphere of radius $a$.
